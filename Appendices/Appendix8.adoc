| Call to Action for Global Access to and Harmonization of Quality Information of Individual Earth Science Datasets
| Other
| Global
| This paper describes the findings of that effort, argues the importance of sharing dataset quality information, calls for community action to develop practical guidelines, and outlines community recommendations for developing such guidelines. Practical guidelines will allow for global access to and harmonization of quality information at the level of individual Earth science datasets, which in turn will support open science.

| International Community Guidelines Sharing and Reusing Quality Information of Individual Earth Science Datasets
| User Guide
| Global
| The community guidelines aim to help stakeholders such as science data centers, repositories, data producers and publishers, data managers and stewards, etc., i) to capture and represent quality information of their datasets in a way that is in line with the FAIR guiding principles; ii) to allow for the maximum trust, sharing, reuse and value of their datasets; and iii) to enable global access to and integration of dataset quality information. The vision of developing these guidelines is to promote the creation and use of freely and openly shared dataset quality information that is consistently described, readily available in community standardized formats, and capable of being integrated across commonly-used Earth science systems and tools for search and access with explicitly expressed usage licenses.

| Updating the Australian Geospatial Reference System (AGRS) and associated
standards.
| Use Case/ Implementation Example
| Regional
| In anticipation of the growing use and reliance on high-accuracy positioning technology, the Australia (and
New Zealand) geodesy community recognised in 2010 the need to develop a modernised and dynamic
national datum. The existing datum, while state of the art when introduced in 1994, was no longer accurate
enough to support new mass market positioning capabilities on the horizon. In addition, due to its location
on one of the fastest tectonic plates (moving at approximately 70 mm per year northward) Australia found
itself out of position, in a global sense, by more than a metre and growing. The new Geocentric datum of
Australia 2020, and Australian Terrestrial Reference Frame 2014 were released in 2017.
